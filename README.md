![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

Angular-Material library this framework is based on provides a pretty complete set of CSS styles that include typography and responsiveness. But, real applications would need more. In Pip.WebUI.CSS we collected generic CSS styles that we reused across many web applications. Also, this module contains so called CSS components. In comparison to Angular directives they are extremely light-weight and efficient, because they require only CSS styles over basic HTML structure.
